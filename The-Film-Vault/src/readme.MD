Planning Deliverables:

1. Use Cases:

   User visits the registration page and submits a form with an email, username, and password.
   Exceptions:
   Registration fails if the username or email is already taken.

   Log In - Allow a user to log in to their account.
   User navigates to the Login Page.
   User enters email/username and password.
   User clicks "Login".
   System verifies credentials:
   If correct, a session is created.
   If incorrect, an error message is displayed.
   If successful, user is redirected to the homepage.


    browse/Movie Search - User navigates to the movie list page.
                    User navigates to the Homepage.
                    The system displays a list of movies.
                    User enters a search query (title, genre, or release year).
                    System filters and returns results.
                    User clicks on a movie to view details.

    Movie Details - User clicks a movie from the Homepage.
                System retrieves movie details (title, genre, director, rating).
                System displays:
                Movie Information
                User Reviews
                "Add to Watchlist" button (for logged-in users).

    Movie Review - User navigates to a movieâ€™s page.
                    User writes a review and assigns a rating (1-5).

     Chat feature (stretch goal) 

Outside Technology Ideas-
1. Websocket (will attempt if time wills it) (allow users to discuss movies live while browsing enabling real time chat)
2. Google Auth Login - Allow users to sign in with Google instead of email/password.
3. Deploy to AWS
4. Tailwind css framework
